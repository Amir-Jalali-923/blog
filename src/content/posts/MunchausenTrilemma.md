That conversation is most likely familiar to you. we're all born as curious skeptics but we tend to gradually lose that spirit somehow, I wonder why. Anyways tho, have you ever wondered what happens if we just don't listen to our parents and keep asking “why?”? well, many people did actually[^1] and one of them was the German philosopher Hans Albert.

# Münchhausen Trilemma
According to Hans, any path of reasoning that you may take to prove a statement will inevitably end in one of these three ways:
- Proof continues to infinity -- `regressive argumnet`
>I believe this news article is accurate.
>
>-Why?
>
>Because I read it on a reliable website.
>
>-Why is that website reliable?
>
>Because it cites trustworthy sources.
>
>-Why are those sources trustworthy?
>
>Because they’re backed by other trustworthy sources
>
>-Why are those other sources trustworthy?
>
>...
- Proof of one statement is proved by the that very statement -- `circular argument`
>I love you.
>
>-Why do you love me?
>
>Because you're my wife.
>
>-Why am I your wife?
>
>Because I love you.
- The proof rests upon some blindly accepted statements -- `dogmatic argument`
>Who created us?
>
>-God did.
>
>How do you know that?
>
>-Because it says so in my holy book.
>
>What if your holy book is wrong?
>
>-No. My holy book is always right.
