That conversation is most likely familiar to you. we're all born as curious skeptics but we tend to gradually lose that spirit somehow, I wonder why. Anyways tho, have you ever wondered what happens if we just don't listen to our parents and keep asking “why?”? well, many people did actually[^1] and one of them was the German philosopher Hans Albert.

# Münchhausen Trilemma
According to Hans, any path of reasoning that you may take to prove a statement will inevitably end in one of these three ways:
- Proof continues to infinity -- `regressive argumnet`
>I believe this news article is accurate.
>
>-Why?
>
>Because I read it on a reliable website.
>
>-Why is that website reliable?
>
>Because it cites trustworthy sources.
>
>-Why are those sources trustworthy?
>
>Because they’re backed by other trustworthy sources
>
>-Why are those other sources trustworthy?
>
>...
- Proof of one statement is proved by the that very statement -- `circular argument`
>I love you.
>
>-Why do you love me?
>
>Because you're my wife.
>
>-Why am I your wife?
>
>Because I love you.
- The proof rests upon some blindly accepted statements -- `dogmatic argument`
>Who created us?
>
>-God did.
>
>How do you know that?
>
>-Because it says so in my holy book.
>
>What if your holy book is wrong?
>
>-No. My holy book is always right.

So as you see, there is no way to prove anything without either falling into a infinitly deep questioning hole, using the statement itself prove itself, or simply assuming some statements to be true by default.

Yep, hate to break it to you but we can never know any absolute truth and this trilemma is only one of many ways to prove it(how ironic). However, eventhough we can never know if somthing is __absolutly__ true, we can know if something is true to a certian degree to rely on. how you may ask, by (kind of) permitting on of the fallacies in the trilemma.
