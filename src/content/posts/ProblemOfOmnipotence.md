> Could god create a rock so heavy that even he himself cannot lift?

The question above (also known as the **paradox of stone**) is probably one of the most go-to questions for atheists when debating god. At it's core, this questions tries to deny the possibility that an omnipotent being can exist. For now, let's just forget about the paradox and explore some of the definitions for omnipotence (we'll get back to the paradox later on in this post). Afterall, in order to label something as *omnipotent*, first, we need to know what it **means** to be *omnipotent*.

## What is Omnipotence?

Imagine you're walking to you're job as a restaurant manager when someone stops you and tells you that they are a pianist and you should hire them in your restaurant. You think about it a little, hiring a pianist would indeed increase the prestige of your restaurant and consequently, more people will come to your place and they'll be willing to spend more money on your services, therefore, you would make more money. So based on all the advantages that is will bring, you decide to hire that pianist, right? Well of course not! What if he is lying and he has absolutely no idea on how to play the piano? Like any normal person with common sense, you decide to put that "pianist" into a test to figure out if they really deserve the title "pianist". How should you do it? It's pretty straight forward actually, take out a piece of paper and write "Things that a pianist should be able to do" on top of it, then proceed to fill in the list, for example:

1. Sight read.
2. Play scales and arpeggios with precision.
3. Interpret different musical styles.
4. Play from memory.
5. Accompany other instruments harmoniously.
6. ...

After completing the list, you demand that person to show you that he is able to do these things comfortably. Or, if the list is infinite, at least do a reasonable number of those tasks. If he succeeds to do so, great! he does deserve the "pianist" title and you ought to hire him in your restaurant.

Analogously, when we want to check if someone is eligible for the title of "omnipotent", we should specify a set of thing which that being should be able to do. And there, you have a template for defining "omnipotent":

> If a being is able to accomplish all the tasks in the set $X$, we call that being *omnipotent*. 

Now all we have to do is defining the set $X$, without running into paradoxes and incoherencies. In other words, we need to answer the question "what can god do?".

Let's figure out the answer by going through a bunch of definitions and criticizing them in a debate-like manner. 

## Definition I

Most theists have a really simple answer to the question: Everything! god can do everything. This view is called ***unqualified omnipotence***.

### objections

You are welcome to totally obliterate this idea by just using simple logic and stating the fact that god cannot do the impossible, because that's what it fucking means to be impossible! It's not rocket science folks, GET IT!

For example, Could god create a square that is a triangle? Or could he make a married bachelor? Clearly no, he can't, and therefore no omnipotent being can exist with this definition.

If you're still not convinced that god can't do these things here is the logical proofs for those same examples:

1. A shape has a static number of sides.
2. Squares and triangles are shapes.
3. Squares have 4 sides.
4. Triangles have 3 sides. 
5. Set of shapes with 3 sides is mutually exclusive from the set of shapes with 4 sides.
6. Therefore, non of the triangles are squares and non of the squares are triangles.

---

1. Bachelors are not married.
2. Set of bachelors is mutually exclusive from the set of married people.
3. Therefore, non of bachelors are married and non of the married are bachelors.

There you have it.

Now, since no theist would abandon they're faith so easily, they will start to think about the argument to see how it went wrong. Speaking from experience, most of them would still insist that god absolutely can do anything, he can even make a square triangle, and when you ask "how?", the typical answer is something like: "Because god transcends logic". In this case you can jump scare them with the almighty stone paradox and enjoy watching them drown in their own stupidity.

However, if the theist is smarter, he would see that the defined omnipotence is indeed incoherent, and instead of insisting on it, he would come up with a better definition.

## Definition II

If you're debating a theist who has at least some experience on religious debate, they would usually define omnipotence like so:

> A being is omnipotent, if he can do all things that are logically possible.

This seems like a pretty good definition. After all, now we can't challenge god with absurd tasks such as making a square triangle because those things are logically impossible. this view is called ***qualified omnipotence*** and it's for sure a much more defendable view compared to the unqualified omnipotence.

### Objections

Although the current definition is much better than the previous one, it still fails to account for the stone paradox. Simply put, It is actually logically possible to create a rock that is unliftable by it's own maker, you don't believe me? Put your shoes on, go out and take a box with yourself, and then start collecting rocks in the box until it's so heavy that you can't lift it. Since you, as a humble human being can accomplish this task, it is indeed logically possible.

the theistic response is usually something along the lines of:

> But there is a problem, you are not omnipotent. When we ask whether God could create such a rock, we're essentially asking an omnipotent being to do something that makes that being no longer omnipotent. It is inconsistent with god's nature and therefore logically impossible.

A great, logical, and plausible response. But now a different problem arises. Now, apart from god, I also am omnipotent, even you are omnipotent, guess what else is omnipotent? A fucking toaster!

You see, when we claim that "if some task is contradictory with a being's nature, then that task is logically impossible", then omnipotence is no longer something special. I'm just as omnipotent as God because I also can do anything that is logically possible. Sure, there are many things that I can't do such as flying or making a universe out of thin air but those things are contradictory with my nature and henceforth, logically impossible to do! Similarly, a toaster can only do some certain things that it's designed to do so, any other expectation from it would be logically impossible.

In a nutshell, Everything in the universe is omnipotence because nothing can do a thing it cannot do, and since God is supposed to be special with being omnipotent, this definition also fails.

## Definition III

We had enough of incoherent gibberish, so let's make it actually work this time:

> The capacity to create, destroy, and rearrange matter and energy in accordance with one's own desires.

There you have it. Or maybe even something that would make theists happy:

>More powerful than any being that exists.

These are indeed very different definitions, but our main goal was to define omnipotence in a way that is coherent and logically consistent, and it seems like we've achieved it. Good job.

## Appendix

Note that in many religious texts, God is explicitly described as a being that can do absolutely all things, so regardless of how hard we try to redefine it to make some room for omnipotence in possible worlds, religions mostly prefer to go with the unqualified omnipotence, as their books says so.

:::tip[FUN FACT]
Apart from claiming that God can do everything, Bible also claims that god can't lie, not that he chooses not to lie, but he is unable to do so. Not at all self-contradictory.
