Before you go searching your dictionary or googling it, here are some common definitions of logic:

-  The study of correct reasoning
-  The study of valid inference
- Thinking about thinking
- The science of arguments and reasoning

These are all nice and valid descriptions, however, they are kind of vague and they lack the philosophical clarity they should have had. why is that the case? well, defining logic is like defining "sports", there are plenty of definitions out there, but any hard and strict answer you give to the question "What is sports?", will inevitably make some people(usually chess players and ballet dancers) mad about it. Same situation also holds true for the question "What is logic?", and that's why we mostly see vague and abstract definitions. But just because we can't perfectly define logic, does not mean that we shouldn't try.

So lets try.

## Understanding Logic Intuitively

We previously made an analogy using "sports", lets stick to it and use another analogy from the world of sports to have a try at understanding what logic is.

Imagine you are holding a tennis ball. Naturally, you can feel it, see it, smell it and taste it, it has a color, a mass, a texture and it occupies a specific place in fabric of space-time, in short it's a tangible object. Now, imagine a game of tennis. Can you hold it?, can you smell it?, how much mass does it have?, does it occupy any place in space-time? of course not. But why? What is the difference?

The difference is that a "game of tennis" is not a tangible object, rather, it is somthing that people **DO**. When you're watching a game of tennis per say, you're not really watching the game of tennis, but a more precise description would be that you're watching people as they play the game of tennis. How do we know that they're playing tennis? Because they are following the rules of tennis. If they're playing by these pre-written rules of tennis, then we say they are playing tennis. If they're not playing by those rules, then we say they are *not* playing tennis.

By analogy, logic is not a tangible object, but rather somthing that people do. Just like tennis, logic also has some rules. When people follow these rules, we say that they're being logical, and when they don't follow these rules, well, we say that they're *not* being logical.

### Logic isn't Objective

Some people would argue that logic exists by itself and independent from humans and it's almost like an external force that governs the universe. It is known as "logical realism" and it's specially common among religious apologists. The reality however is that logic is essentially just a human **invention** and not an ethereal universal force, it is just something that we humans invented to help us do some specific things more optimally. Just as languages like, English, French and Persian are invented by humans, to help us communicate optimally.

### Logic is a Language

We understood that logic is a set of rules, these rules are similar to the rules we use in English or any other language. Just like languages provide a linguistic convention in order to communicate effectively, logic also provides a similar kind of convention in order to communicate clearly. In fact logic **is** a language, it's just a different type of language.

 Unlike languages like English, French and Persian that are *natural* or *informal languages* and are used for effective communications, logic is a *formal language*. Formal languages are used to form strict and clear communications. programming languages and mathematical notation are examples of formal languages.

## The Need for Formal Languages

> I saw the man, on the hill, with a telescope.

The sentence above is a valid, English sentence. But you may have noticed that it is a bit vague. Do i have the telescope? Does the man have it? Or does no one have it, and it is just sitting there on the hill? Even though the sentence is valid, there is no correct answer to my question unless some extra information is provided.

This is a well known concept in natural languages called "ambiguity". It isn't necessarily a bad thing either, it is commonly used by poets and songwriters to add multiple layers to their pieces and it also can be used to make funny jokes (puns).

However, there are some cases that we need to be as clear and precise as possible, for example when you want to send a rocket to space or borrow money from the bank, In these scenarios, there is no room for ambiguity. That is why we need formal languages.   Mathematicians, programmers, lawyers and engineers always use these kind of languages because they need precise communication.


### How Logic Brings clarity

Lets get back to our example and try to make it a little bit more formal:

>I saw the man *and* he was on the hill, *and* he had a telescope.

Great! the sentence is much more clear now, we indeed know that the man had the telescope. This is a classic example of using *logical connectives* that falls under the scope of **classical propositional logic**. There are many other logical connectives that you're probably familiar with, such as `or`, `if then`, `nor`, `exclusive or(xor)` and `if and only if`.

Similarly, we can use other logical frameworks to formalize other types of sentences. For example:

> *For every* car in the road, *there exists* a driver.

This sentence is constructed using **first-order logic** which lets you to use things like `universal quantifier`(*for all* or $\forall$) and `existential quantifier`(*exists* or $\exists$).

> It is *possible* to paint your car green, but it's *necessary* to put wheels on it.

This sentence uses **modal logic** which lets you work with `necessity`($\Box$) and `possibility`($\Diamond$).

## Deductive Systems

Now, we know that logic a formal language that is used in order to communicate strictly and clearly. But that's not all. Logic is often used for analyzing the interplay between ideas. In order to do that, we need something called a *deductive system*. 

At it's simplest form, a deductive system is just like the grammar in natural languages. Grammar tells you how and in what order to stick words together so that others can understand what you mean, likewise, a deductive system tells you how to stick propositions together in order to make valid arguments.

1. The blue car is broken
2. Broken is blue the car.

The first sentence is grammatically correct, because it follows the rules of grammar in English language. The second sentence is grammatically incorrect, because it simply fails to follow those rules.

1. 1. If it's raining then the floor is wet.
   2. It's raining.
   3. Therefore the floor is wet.
2. 1. If it's raining then the floor is wet.
   2. The floor is wet.
   3. Therefore it's raining.

The first argument, follows the rules of deduction (modus ponens), therefore it is said to be *valid*. If however, it didn't follow those rules, we would say that it is *invalid*, like the second argument.



### Logical Realism

It is also important to know that, just as there is no universally correct way of doing grammar (different natural languages use different grammars), there is no universally correct way of sticking propositions together. The sentence "I have an apple." could, in practice be written like "I an apple have.", is this sentence objectively "wrong"? NO, it just doesn't follow the rules of English grammar, it does however, follow the rules of Persian grammar, if we replaced each word with its literal translation, we would get a correctly constructed Persian sentence. 

Same thing is also true with deduction. take the syllogism below as an example: 

1. All men are mortal.
2. Socrates is a man.
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

 There isn't a superior transcendent force in the universe obligating us to accept that Socrates is mortal (given that both premises are true), of course not, we just follow the rules of deduction and it takes us to the conclusion. Just like with the grammar, you could say "Fuck you" to those rules and claim that Socrates is not mortal, nothing is really stopping you from doing so, however, it's like telling your friend let's play basketball before punching him/her in the face and shouting "Checkmate" afterwards. It's not playing by the rules.

### Logic and Reality

With that being said, no deductive system ever will be able to tell you what is true about the objective reality, at best, it can tell you whether your attempts to describe reality has been formulated correctly.

## Semantics

With the help of a deductive system, we can now derive to valid conclusions from premises. So our logic seems pretty complete, however there is one thing left, take a look at the syllogism below:

1. All vardels are kikies.
2. Coco is a vardle.
3. Therefore, coco is kiki.

This is a valid syllogism and it follows the rules of deduction. But so what? Should we now agree that coco is kiki? Of course not. But why? Well because why should we agree that are vardels are kikies in the first place? Rules of deduction only helps you to derive at true conclusions if all your premises are also true. Now that we don't know whether or not our premises are true, how should we determine that?

In order to do figure out the truth about our premises, we need something called *semantics*.

### Truth Values

If we want to work with semantics, first we need to determine what kind of truth values are we going to use. Generally we use the binary set of truth values which includes `true` and `false`: $$\{T, F\}$$. However keep in mind that you can always use any other set of truth values, in fact you could go on and invent your own set of truth values right now.

Besides the binary set, there are some other truth value sets that are commonly used, for example *trinary logic* uses a set of three truth values: $\{T, F, U\}$. And also there is fuzzy logic which uses a whole spectrum of truth values: $[0, 1]$.

### Truth Assignment

after deciding which truth values we're going to use, we need to have a system to assign each proposition a value from that set, in logic, that system is called a *truth assignment function*; some people also refer to it as *epistemological systems*. There is again, no objectively correct function to use for this process and we practically can use whatever we want. For example, I will take my grandmother's word as my truth assignment function, I simply ask her "are all vardels kikies?" and if she responds "Yes", then I mark that proposition as true, otherwise, I mark it as false.

Of course, in reality no one will simply take my grandmother's word for it, and that's why there are better truth assignment functions that are agreed upon by most of people.

### Axioms

A common method of truth assignment is declaring some propositions as true by default and see where we can get to from there. These propositions are called *axioms* and we use them all the time. For example, these are the axioms of natural numbers:

1. $0$ is a natural number.
2. For every natural number $n$, $n = n$.
3. For all natural numbers $a$ and $b$, if $a = b$, then $b = a$.
4. For every natural number $n$, the successor to $n$, $S(n) = n + 1$, is also a natural number.
5. There is no natural number $n$ such that $S(n) = 0$.

Why exactly we should accept these propositions as true, because we say so! these are just some propositions that I want them to be thought as true when we're talking about natural numbers, outside of the world of natural numbers however, I am not claiming anything to be true.

:::note
Defining axioms as true is not circular. Just remember the fact when defining axioms, we don't claim anything about objective truth, but we're simply labeling some propositions as true in order to create a truth assignment function. If that function works well and the way we wanted it to work, then we stick to those axioms, if not, we modify them until we have the functionality we expected.
:::

### Theorems

After stablishing axioms we can derive to new propositions based on our deductive system. Those proposition if true, will be called *theorems*. Here is an example of a theorem derived from the axioms of natural numbers:

1. For every natural number $n$, $n = n$.
2. $0$ is a natural number.
3. Therefore, $0 = 0$.

:::note
Theorems represent the heart of all mathematical inquiry, that's why we say mathematics are "invented" and not "discovered".
:::

## Conclusion

So, what is logic? it's a formal language coupled with a deductive system and semantic interpretations. Of course, this again is not a perfect defenition and many experts in this field would take issue with the finer details, and that fine. The point is that we can clearly see that logic is not absence of emotional impulsivity nor it is an ethereal force that governs the universe, but it's a linguistic convention with strict rules, rules that are designed to help us express ideas clearly and rigorously and analyze the interplay between them.
