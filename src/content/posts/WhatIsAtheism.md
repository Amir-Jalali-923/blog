Suppose you're chatting with your friend as usual when he tells you that he's an atheist. If you're like most of the people, the first thing that comes to your mind about him is this: "he believes God doesn't exist". The ultimate claim of atheism. Or Is it?

In order to understand what atheism means, let's first define theism. There are many definitions but without considering minor details, theism at it's core means "belief in existence of at least one god". Before turning our attention back to atheism, let's also clarify what "belief" means: "a mental state in which a person accepts that a statement is true, even if there is no proof to support that statement".

Now, the modern definition for atheism is "the absence of belief in any god". This could be easily misinterpreted as "belief in non-existence of god" but they are very different[^1]. Atheism is not a belief, but rather a rejection of belief in god, this means that atheism doesn't claim that god doesn't exist, it simply is the refusal of the **belief** in god. In simple words: 

> As long as it isn't proven to me that god exists, I may not accept that statement as true. However, this does not mean that I regard it as false.

It's really important to understand this in order to have an effective debate with an atheist without asking them dumbass questions like:

- Can you prove God doesn't exist?
- How did the universe come into existence?
- How did life come into existence?

These are all very interesting philosophical questions, but they do not challenge atheism:

- First, as we figured out few seconds ago, atheism doesn't claim that god doesn't exist and therefore, it doesn't have to prove such a thing.

- Second, most atheists would respond as "I don't know" but even if they hold any belief about how universe came to existence, disproving that belief wouldn't magically prove that god did it. For example, let's say that I believe some human beings flew into space and constructed all the planets, galaxies, and anything that exists in the observable universe. You can easily prove this isn't the case because the universe is older than human beings. However this does not prove that a God or more specifically your God created the universe.

- Third, just like the universe case, even if the atheist you're debating with holds any beliefs about this topic, disproving it wouldn't prove that god created life. 

So, next time you're debating with an atheist, keep in mind that what you have to do as the theist is to first prove that a God exists, and then prove that that God is indeed your God (The God that you or your religion defines) by providing plausible arguments and/or empirical (not anecdotal) evidence.

I hope you enjoyed reading.

[^1]: Atheism used to mean "belief in non-existence of God" for a long time. The word "atheism" stems from the Greek word "atheos". The prefix "a-" means "without" and "theos" means "god", together, "atheos" means "without god" or "godless". This continued to be the way the word was used up until approximately a 120 years ago, and then it gradually evolved to it's modern definition.
